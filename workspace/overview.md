# AURA-Sense Workspace Overview

Status: Active
Last reviewed: 2026-05-24

## Vision Statement

AURA-Sense is a tactical viewport for recent EVE Online operational observations.

It should present compact, uncertainty-aware tactical state while staying transient, backend-owned, live-gated, and distinct from AURA Atlas historical evidence storage.

## Coordination Model

- `workspace/current.md` is the only active executable work packet.
- `docs/roadmap/` defines milestone meaning and accepted direction.
- Handshake files in `workspace/` are active-milestone transaction notes.
- Completed milestone handshakes move in batch to `workspace/complete/milestone-XX/`.
- Former `docs/gap` task files are archived historical context only.

## Milestone Plan

| Milestone | Roadmap Source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 13 | `docs/roadmap/milestone-13-aggressive-testing-and-bug-hunting.md` | Complete | Offline aggressive hardening accepted; live/manual validation remains gated for later operator-validation work. |
| 14 | `docs/roadmap/milestone-14-back-page-threat-intel-ux.md` | Complete | Back-page Threat Intel UX accepted; live/manual shortcut feel remains gated for optional later operator-validation work. |
